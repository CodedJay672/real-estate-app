    question:
      "What are the most important documents to check before buying land in Nigeria?",
    answer:
      "Before purchasing land, ensure you verify documents like the Certificate of Occupancy (C of O), Deed of Assignment, Survey Plan, and Governorâ€™s Consent. These documents confirm ownership and legal status, helping to avoid land disputes or buying government-acquired land.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it better to buy land or a built property in Nigeria?",
    answer:
      "It depends on your goals. Buying land offers flexibility and lower upfront costs, especially for long-term investment. Built properties, however, are ready for immediate use or rental income, but they may cost more and offer less design freedom.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a non-Nigerian own property in Nigeria?",
    answer:
      "Yes, non-Nigerians can own property in Nigeria, but typically through a leasehold arrangement of up to 99 years. However, foreigners must get approval from the state government and must not acquire land in areas designated as restricted.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What are the risks of buying real estate in Nigeria, and how can I avoid them?",
    answer:
      "Common risks include land scams, fraudulent sellers, family disputes, and unclear land titles. To avoid these, always engage a real estate lawyer, conduct due diligence, and work with registered agents or reputable companies.",
